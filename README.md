The administrative system is responsible for responding to the driver’s request for consultancy with its recommendation (appeal/legal advice/ lawyer consultation). 

The web application administrator can track and review all his ingoing/outgoing messages through the web application’s messaging system. The clerk’s web messaging system contains all drivers’ message requests and uploaded documents. Furthermore, the web application manages an automatic text System with a wide-range of detailed appeal text templates (each corresponding to the root cause of appeal). 
The web application activates a service that sends a push notification message through Google Cloud’s messaging system to the driver’s application for immediate updates in the handling of his police traffic report.
